# BibleBot
 
This is a chatbot that uses Twilio API to provide users with a random Bible verse when prompted. The chatbot uses NTLK to tokenize words and understand different phrases. 

Furthermore, the chatbot also takes keywords and provides a Bible verse pertaining to that keyword (i.e, the user prompts for a Bible verse about love, and the chatbot will provide one random Bible verse that contains the word "love").
